# Ordered Data Structures
___
This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-2?specialization=cs-fundamentals), you will learn new data structures for efficiently storing and retrieving data that is structured in an ordered sequence. Such data includes an alphabetical list of names, a family tree, a calendar of events or an inventory organized by part numbers. The specific data structures covered by this course include arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees and heaps. This course also shows, through algorithm complexity analysis, how these structures enable the fastest algorithms to search and sort data.   
**Week 1:** Orientation; Linear Structures   
**Week 2:** Introduction to Tree Structures    
**Week 3:** Advanced to Tree Structures    
**Week 4:** Heap Structures
